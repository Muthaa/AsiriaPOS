This project uses JWT authentication via [SimpleJWT](https://django-rest-framework-simplejwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Obtain Token (Login)

POST `/api/token/`

Request body:
```json
{
  "phone_number": "your_phone_number",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "refresh": "<refresh_token>",
  "access": "<access_token>"
}
```

### Refresh Token

POST `/api/token/refresh/`

Request body:
```json
{
  "refresh": "<refresh_token>"
}
```

Response:
```json

}
```

### Using the Access Token

Include the following header in your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```
